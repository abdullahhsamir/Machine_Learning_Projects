# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of my personal projects related to machine learning. Each project explores different aspects of machine learning, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring any of the machine learning projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.
2. Navigate to the project folder you want to explore.
3. Read the project's README.md file to understand the problem statement, methodology, and results.
4. If available, check the `Notebook` for the source code and scripts related to the project.
5. If the project uses a dataset, you can find it in here.

Feel free to explore the projects, experiment with the code, and provide any feedback or suggestions. I hope you find these machine learning projects informative and inspiring!
